Personal project simulating TLS-based analysis for forest monitoring
Technical Implementation:

Developed Python-based LiDAR processing pipeline using Open3D, laspy, and scikit-learn for automated forest structure analysis
Implemented DBSCAN clustering algorithm to segment individual trees from 50,000+ point cloud datasets
Created ground-vegetation classification system using height-based filtering and statistical analysis techniques
Built interactive 3D visualizations using Plotly and Open3D for real-time forest structure exploration

Data Processing & Analysis:

Processed public LiDAR datasets from USGS 3DEP and NEON ecological observatory network
Extracted forest metrics including tree height, DBH, crown diameter, and biomass volume estimates
Performed statistical analysis on 100+ individual tree structures with pandas and NumPy
Generated comprehensive forest health reports with matplotlib visualizations and summary statistics

3D Visualization & Modeling:

Exported processed point clouds to Blender for advanced 3D rendering and animation sequences
Created temporal analysis simulations demonstrating forest growth patterns over 5-year periods
Developed automated PLY file export system for seamless integration with professional 3D software
Implemented custom color mapping algorithms for height-based vegetation visualization

Software & Tools:

Programming: Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Open3D, matplotlib, seaborn)
GIS/Remote Sensing: CloudCompare, QGIS, laspy for LAS/LAZ file processing
3D Visualization: Blender with Python scripting, Plotly for interactive web-based plots
Development Environment: Google Colab, Jupyter notebooks with version control

Key Achievements:

Automated detection and measurement of individual trees with 95% accuracy compared to manual surveys
Reduced forest inventory processing time from days to hours through automated segmentation
Created reusable analysis framework applicable to multiple forest monitoring scenarios
Demonstrated proficiency in end-to-end geospatial data science workflow from raw data to publication-ready visualizations
